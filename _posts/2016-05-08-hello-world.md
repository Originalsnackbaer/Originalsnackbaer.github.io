# Hello world! This headline is for SEO

This is my first blogpost.  
I use eckige Klammern mit alt+5 und alt+6 [markdown](http://markdown.de).

Somebody once said:

> You only live once.

What do I need to **buy tomorrow**?

- milk
- bread
- apples

What did we learn *today*?

1. git
2. atom
3. markdown
4. jekyll

## This is a smaller headline

### This is an even smaller headline

#### This is super small

##### This is barely a headline any more

###### This is as small as you can go

Look what you can do with blockquotes

> This is a blockquote

> 1. git
> 2. atom
> 3. markdown
>> 4. jekyll

Holding down the cmd key and clicking with cursor in front of every number creates 4 cursors

inline formatierung muss man immer auf UND zu machen

block-formatierung muss man nur aufmachen

I got an email from Bob:

> Monday is perfect
>
> > When would you like to meet up?

this .. means go one directory up

## images

![this is the description for hovering cursor and search enginges](../img/7.jpg)

now we go back to github desktop, commit changes and sync
